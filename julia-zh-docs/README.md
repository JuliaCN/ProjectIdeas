## Description

Difficulty: Basic

Since the realease of Julia 1.0, the functionality of Julia has been stable. The ecosystem and usage tips have also been established. However, for beginners in the Chinese community, it is a pity that a large amount of technical information is presented in English, which leads to a very different experience for people who can read and write English and people who cannot read and write English.

This project aims to provide language support for beginners, so that they can more easily master the use of Julia, and more conveniently access Chinese materials in the field of interest. In addition to document translation, students participating in the project are also encouraged to write related translation tools. For example, use ChatGPT API to polish the translated text, or write a script that can generate Markdown text in Chinese and English alternately.

The tool packages that currently support API calls include OpenAI.jl and ChatAPICall.jl, and development can be based on these tool packages.

The recommended documents for translation are:

1. Plotting
   - Plot.jl (Plotting)
   - Makie.jl (Plotting)

2. Image processing
   - Images.jl (Image processing)
   - Luxor.jl (Vector graphics)

3. Others
   - SciMLStyle (Programming style guide)


Students can provide a list of translated documents based on their interests and preferences.

## Requirements

- Familiar with the use of Julia
- Have sufficient understanding of the content to be translated, such as image processing, plotting, etc.
