## Description

The project aims to implement the Universal Enveloping Algebra of Lie algebras in Julia. Key features of this project:
- Implementation of Universal Enveloping Algebra from given Lie algebras
- Allowing basic operations and manipulations on the algebras
- Integrating with existing Computer Algebra Systems (CAS)

## Requirements

- Interest in computer algebra systems and symbolic computation
- Basic knowledge in Lie algebras and their classifications
- Basic knowledge in Julia programming language
